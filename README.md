# Radar-System-Robotics

Radar is a long-range object detection system that uses radio waves to establish certain parameters of an object like its range, speed and position. Radar technology is used in aircrafts, missiles, marine, weather predictions and automobiles.
Even though the title says Arduino Radar Project, technically the project is based on Sonar technology as I will be using an Ultrasonic Sensor to determine the presence of any object in a particular range.

# Project Overview:
The Arduino Radar Project is more of a visual project than it is a circuit implementation. Of course, I will be using different hardware like Arduino UNO, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and a Servo Motor but the main aspect is the visual representation in the Processing Application.

If you remember, I have already used the Processing Application in one of the earlier Arduino Projects involving MPU-6050 Sensor. I suggest you to take a look at that project before proceeding (you donâ€™t have to actually implement the project but understand the way it is implemented).


# Hardware:
Arduino UNO
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
TowerPro SG90 Servo Motor 
Mounting Bracket for Ultrasonic Sensor (optional) 
Connecting Wires 
Jumper Cables 
5V Power Supply 
USB Cable (for Arduino)
